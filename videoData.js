There I impose the book either two up, four up or six up using PDF Snake imposition software. After that I send the imposed file to the appropriate printing press. Covers get laminated on one side before proceeding to the CP Bourg 3002 perfect binder. There is where the covers get glued to the book block. Finally a quick trip through the Challenge CMT 330 three knife trimmer and the books are finished. It's that easy! Thanks for watching.",
